## What is Mission Planner

**Mission Planner** is a mature **ArduPilot** ground control station combining firmware flashing, parameter configuration, complex mission building, streaming telemetry, **SITL** simulation, and powerful geo tools. It is widely used across mapping, inspection, agriculture, research, and training where repeatability, checklists, and deep **.BIN** log analytics are mandatory.

---

## Key Features

- 🔌 **Firmware & setup**: board auto-detection, firmware loading, IMU/compass/radio/ESC wizards, geofence, failsafe.  
- 🗺️ **Missions**: altitude/speed/hold tasks, payload triggers, geometric grids/corridors/polygons with terrain awareness.  
- 🛰️ **Telemetry**: HUD, live plots, event logs, health/status warnings.  
- 🌐 **Geo**: online/offline maps, DEM terrain, KML/CSV/GeoJSON export and reprojection.  
- 🧪 **Simulation**: SITL, log-based flight replays, Lua/MAVProxy scripting.

## Advanced Capabilities

- 🧰 Parameter mass-edits, comparisons, platform templates.  
- 📈 .BIN log analyzer: vibration/energy/nav plots, anomaly search, event markers.  
- 👥 Multi-link ops: UDP/TCP/serial, telemetry forwarding, distributed monitoring.  
- 🔄 Fleet workflows: reusable mission profiles, batch parameter updates.
